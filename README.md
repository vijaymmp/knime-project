# Email Spam Detection using Naive Bayes (KNIME)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **spam email detection system** built using the **Naive Bayes algorithm** in KNIME Analytics Platform.  
It classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on textual features.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- KNIME Analytics Platform
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Text Processing Nodes

## 📂 Project Files
- `Email spam detection Naive bayes.knwf` → Main KNIME workflow

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download and install [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/downloads).
2. Clone this repository or download the `.knwf` file.
3. In KNIME:
   - Go to **File → Import KNIME Workflow…**
   - Select the `.knwf` file
   - Open the workflow and run it.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Try other ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
- Add more advanced preprocessing (like lemmatization).
- Build a dashboard for results.
